Mersenne numbers trial factoring 

This is a code for trial factoring Mersenne numbers. 
The purpose of this repository is to test and improve the code. 
The output is a text in json format that summarizes the values ​​found. 
You can call the program with the values ​​of p bit_lo bit_hi to search for factors of the Mersenne number 2^p-1 in the range from 2^bit_lo to 2^bit_hi. 
Alternatively, you can call the program with p_start p_stop bit_lo bit_hi to search for factors of Mersenne numbers with exponents from p_start to p_stop
